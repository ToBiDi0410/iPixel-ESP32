# ESP32-iPixel

**ESP32-iPixel** is a project to control **iPixel color matrices** using an ESP32 microcontroller.  
It exposes the device‚Äôs functionality via a **REST API** served by a built-in web server.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è UNSTABLE
This is currently only work-in-progress with the only supported device beeing the ESP32-S3 (SuperMicro).  
Support for further ESP32 boards is planned.

## üì° Endpoints
All endpoints are **device-specific**, identified by `:mac` (the device's MAC address).  
You have to determine this BLE-address on your own (e.g. using Android Apps).  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è When an endpoint is called for the first time, the ESP32 connects to the device.  
> This may temporarily return **HTTP 408 (Request Timeout)**.

3. Open a **Chromium-based browser** and visit [https://install.wled.me/](https://install.wled.me/).
4. Click **Install** and select your device.
5. Connect to WiFi:

   * Click **Connect to WiFi** and wait for the scan to finish.
   * Select your WiFi network and enter credentials.
   * Wait for the connection to establish.
6. Click **Visit Device** to get the IP address.

## üìù Todo
* Arbitrary `setPixels` to draw a custom framebuffer
* Device pairings (save devices instead of always using the mac)
* Password or key-based protection
* Connection improvements (faster connect? better disconnect handling?)
* Clock Mode via NTP (set Display as clock)
* Web Flasher Support
